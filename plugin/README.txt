== What is GValidation  ==

GValidation is a validation plugin for Griffon  - A Grails like application
framework for developing desktop applications in Groovy. Like most part of
the Griffon framework GValidation's syntax and usage closely resemble its
cousin Grails' validation and constraints support. However the similarity
pretty much stops here, since Griffon model are very different from Grails'
concept of model. In Grails model usually refers to domain classes that are
bound to database, however in Griffon models are usually just mere POGOs
thus this plugin is designed to work with Griffon models as well as any
POGOs.

GValidation is written purely in Groovy while retaining most of the syntax
of Grails constraints support.
